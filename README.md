# ESMDI
ESMDI is a console application which enables you to transfer sound samples to and from a sampler using the SMDI protocol.

It is created by Erik Jansson, and based on the [OpenSMDI](https://github.com/rdmark/OpenSMDI) library written by Christian Nowak.

ESMDI is currently a Linux-only application.

This is a fork from the original [SourceForge project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/esmdi/).
